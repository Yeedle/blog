Every book needs a cover, every jar a lid, and every blog a 'hello world' post. This is mine. Hello and welcome to my blog.

What kind of posts can you expect to see here? Well, for one, I'm a big fan of R, or more precisely, the [#tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/). As [Hadley Wickham](https://twitter.com/hadleywickham), the high priest of the tidyverse himself, [said](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/3mp9r7/im_hadley_wickham_chief_scientist_at_rstudio_and/cvhl63u)

> If you want to give back, I think writing a blog is a great way. Many of the things that you struggle with will be common problems. Think about how to solve them well and describe your solution to others.

So, a lot of what I hope to be doing here is "describe [my] solution to others." I also hope to write about computer science/programming stuff in general. Finally, I hope to write posts to accompany some of my past and future projects.

Some blog-related credits: This blog is hosted on [GitHub Pages](pages.github.com), ~~powered by [Jekyll](jekyllrb.com), themed by [Lanyon](https://github.com/poole/lanyon), and generated by [knitr](https://github.com/yihui/knitr-jekyll)[^1]~~ and is powered by [VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/). 

[^1]: ~~[And you can too!](http://statistics.rainandrhino.org/knitr-lanyon/)~~ In April of 2018 VueJS creator Evan You announced the release of VuePress, and I decided to switch to that. While VuePress is really geared towards generating documentation websites, having the power of Vue at my fingertips was really enticing, and converting to a blog was relatively easy. It is still missing some important blog features, but they will come in due time.
